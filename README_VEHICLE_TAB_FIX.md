# Fix for "Vehicle tab is not loading data" Issue

## Issue
The vehicle tab in the customer view is not loading any vehicle data. This occurs because the database table for storing vehicle information (`customer_vehicles`) was not properly created during the initial setup.

## Root Cause
The migration file that should create the `customer_vehicles` table had a premature return statement that prevented the table from being created. This was originally added as a workaround for a "stuck in processing" issue, but it resulted in the table not being created at all.

## Solution
The solution is to fix the migration file and run it to create the `customer_vehicles` table.

### Steps Taken to Fix the Issue:
1. Modified the migration file `2023_07_15_000000_create_customer_vehicles_table.php` to:
   - Remove the premature return statement
   - Uncomment the table creation code
   - Add a check to prevent errors if the table already exists

2. The migration can now be run using the existing `run_migration.php` script or manually using artisan.

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Using the provided script
1. Upload the updated migration file to your server
2. Run the `run_migration.php` script by navigating to it in your browser or by running it from the command line:
   ```
   php run_migration.php
   ```
3. The script will execute the migration and create the necessary table

### Option 2: Running the migration manually
1. Upload the updated migration file to your server
2. Connect to your server via SSH or terminal
3. Navigate to your Laravel application directory
4. Run the following command:
   ```
   php artisan migrate
   ```
5. This will run all pending migrations, including the one for the `customer_vehicles` table

## Verification
After running the migration, go to a customer's profile and click on the Vehicles tab. The tab should now load properly and display any vehicles associated with the customer. You should also be able to add, edit, and delete vehicles without errors.

## Additional Information
If you encounter any issues with foreign key constraints during the migration, you may need to modify the migration file to match your database schema. The current migration assumes:
- `contacts` table has an `id` column of type `unsignedInteger`
- `business` table has an `id` column of type `unsignedInteger`
- `users` table has an `id` column of type `unsignedInteger`
