# POS System Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of actionable improvement tasks for the POS system. Tasks are organized by category and priority.

## How to Use This Checklist

This checklist is designed to help track and prioritize improvements to the POS system. Each task is marked with a checkbox `[ ]` that can be checked off when completed.

To mark a task as completed:
1. Edit this file
2. Change `[ ]` to `[x]` for the completed task
3. Commit the change with a descriptive message

Tasks are organized into logical categories, with more specific sub-tasks listed under each main task. When all sub-tasks are completed, the main task can be marked as completed.

Priority should be given to tasks that:
1. Address critical security vulnerabilities
2. Improve system stability and performance
3. Enhance maintainability of the codebase
4. Add high-value features for users

Regular reviews of this checklist should be conducted to update priorities and add new tasks as needed.
